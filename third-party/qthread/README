Chapel modifications to Qthreads
================================

The modifications that we have made to the official Qthreads release are
as follows:

* We force tasks being woken from sync vars to run on their original
  shepherd. This is to work around a task serialization bug that stems
  from us using schedulers that don't support work stealing (nemesis)
  or running with work stealing disabled (distrib w/ QT_STEAL_RATIO=0)

* We added a simple mechanism to reset the automatic task spawning
  order for better affinity between consecutive parallel loops.

* We added a prototype mechanism for dynamically pinning/unpinning
  threads at runtime.

* We deleted the register keyword from the code because it is
  deprecated in C++, causing warnings (that get turned into errors
  with the compiler switch -Werror) when qthread.h is included from
  C++ runtime code.  This change is from the following PR that we have
  submitted upstream.
